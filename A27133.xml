         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY dear Friends, Brethren and Siſters, who are the called and choſen of God, out of the world, out of the nature, ſpirit, vanities and wayes of it, to follow the Lamb in the Regeneration, through the daily croſs, the ſtreight gait and narrow way, which leads to life; ye whoſe hearts breath and pant for the full enjoyment of the glorious liberty, which was with the Father before the world b gan, and are travelling with your faces towards the holy Hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> and cannot be ſatisfied with all the Treaſures and glory of this preſent evil world, nor in any thing or creature, but only in the pure, eternal, refreſhing preſence of your God, in which are Rivers of pleaſure, and joy for evermore. You who have cried to the Lord in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to go forth to ſacrifice unto him in the wilderneſs; ſenſibly feeling, that while the precious Seed of his Covenant lay in death and the grave, it could not praiſe him; who hath perfectly known, that except the dead riſe, all hearing, faith, and preaching to you was in vain, who were ſtill in your ſins and weighed down with corruptions, and overcome with divers temptations in that ſtate. But now hath the Lord your God heard your cries and your groanings, and revealed his Arm of ſalvation, and brought you forth to the Light, and hath ſaid to the priſoner of hope, ſhew thy ſelf, and hath raiſed the Begger from the dunghil, and anſwered the tender cries of his innocent Babe, which could not live, nor be ſatisfied, without the ſincere milk of the eternal Word of life; and ye have grown up from ſtrength to ſtrength, and have great experience of the loving kindneſs of your God (and of his many deliverances in the times of need, and of his wonders upon the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi>) which you have known to be as a cloud by day, and as a Pillar of Fire by night, and hath led you in a way you knew not, and in paths which you had not gone, and hath made himſelf known amongſt you by his Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> in which is everlaſting ſtrength.</p>
            <p>And now, O ye children of the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Is it your lot again to be driven by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his huge Hoſt, to the Borders of the Red Sea? are the Mountains on each ſide, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> behind you, purſuing with Horſmen and Chariots, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you from being a people and to root out the remembrance of your Name, and the Name of your God, from under Heaven: Why, this I proclame unto you all in the Name of my God and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42618:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>your God, Stand ſtill, ſtand ſtill, and you ſhall ſee his mighty ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for with a mighty hand and out-ſtretched arm will he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his choſen. Wherefore take no thought for your life, but free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give up all into his hand, and caſt all your care upon him, for not one hair of your head ſhall periſh, beyond the permiſſion of your heavenly Father, for ye are of more value unto him than many Birds of the Air, which cannot light on the earth without his Providence; and be not afraid of any amazement, O ye dear travelling children, the Lord of Hoſts is your helper, who is in the midſt of you, and his ſervant <hi>David</hi> a Prince among you: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear not the Armies of the Aliens, <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Oh ſink down, ſink down out of all thoughts, contrivings, or premeditations, and feel it, feel it, ye crying, travelling children, who have no helper in the earth, but the Lord your God alone, in whom is your everlaſting ſtrength. O ye Babes of uprightneſs, ye Sons and Daughters of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> comparable to fine gold, My ſoul is poured forth like water, before my God for you, that ye might be preſerved and give up all to him as freely as he doth require it, in this day of tryal, and hour of temptation, that not an Ox or Sheep may be left behind to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from enjoying the Kingdome, with any pretence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, remembring that obedience is more than Sacrifice: for the Lord loveth a cheerful giver, whoſe love you will feel to be ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than death, <hi>which the many waters cannot quench, neither can the ſtoods drown it.</hi> Have not many of you this experience, as ye have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully followed the Lamb through your greateſt Tribulations? and have ye not felt a waſhing your Robes white in his precious blood (the Life?) and have ye not learned a new Song, which he hath put in your mouths, after manifold Deliverances and Victories, which he hath wrought for you, even in the ſight of the Heathen?</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſay unto you, Lift up, lift up your Heads, ye Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Lord of Hoſts is with us, whoſe Arm is not ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42618:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Lamb is upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> with his hundred, forty and four thouſands, gathering his numberleſs number from the four winds. Caſt off all mortal thoughts, and the cares of this world, let not the Earth weigh you down, ſtand, ſtand upon the Watch-Tower, put on the whole Armour of God, give no place to the Devil, quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, within; then will ye not fear what man, or the ſons of men, can do unto you: The God of <hi>Jacob</hi> is your Refuge, who will break the bow of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſnap their Spears aſunder, and burn their Chariots in the fire, and make deſolations in the earth; he is fulfilling his promiſes of old, made to his Choſen, who will give Nations for them, and and people for their life. I ſay, ye Worthies of the Lord, ſtand faithful, and be valiant for the truth upon the earth; for its againſt it they are fighting (within and without) that it might fall in the Streets, and be extinguiſhed from the earth, and that equity and righteouſneſs may not enter the Nations, who have ſaid in their hearts, <hi>Come, let us kill the Heir, and the Inheritance will be ours:</hi> But in vain do the Heathen rage, and the people imagine ſuch fooliſh things; for their hope ſhall periſh, and their purpoſes be made void, they ſhall never bring to paſs the thoughts of their hearts; the Lord hath ſpoken it, <hi>for the Seed of evil doers ſhall never be renowned.</hi> Wherefore, if ye hear of Wars, or Rumors, or Commotions, or Peſtilences, or Famines, or the ruſhing of the ungodly, like the noyſe of the raging Sea, which cannot reſt, let not your heart be troubled, the Lord of Heaven and Earth (who is above all) will rebuke the devourer for your ſakes, for your Redemption draweth nigh when ye ſee theſe things come to paſs. And this is the word of the Eternal God unto all people upon the earth, the Redemption of his Seed draweth nigh, and haſtneth to be delivered, as a woman in travel. Therefore ye Babes of God, ye Souldiers of the Lamb, put on Zeal as a Garment, and Righteouſneſs as a Breſt-plate, and be cloathed with Humility, and dwell in the Dread and Majeſty of the Almighty, and let your hearts be fixed without wavering, look not back, remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife; for theſe are the days of vengeance, of tribulations, and diſtreſs of Nations, with great perplexi y, mens hearts failing them for fear looking at the things that are coming upon the earth: Now ſhall they ſee the Son of man coming in the Clouds of Heaven with power and great glory; now ſhall the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>whom they have pierced: But rejoyce, yea, ſing, and rejoyce, ye children of the Bride Chamber, who are redeemed from the earth (and yet watch and pray continually) for the Lord will make your terrour (which is already begun) to fall upon all fleſh, as the faithfull to him abide, and the fear of you, and the dread of you (O ye retired, meek, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect Babes) ſhall be upon every Beaſt of the field; <hi>and men in honour, not underſtanding</hi> (the Decree and Counſel of our God) <hi>are like the Beaſts that periſh,</hi> and periſhing and withering ſhall be upon every hand that is ſtretched forth againſt his way and work in the earth; though they ariſe as the Locuſts to compaſs the breadth thereof, the Lord of Heaven ſhall blaſt them, and they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as dung upon the open field.</p>
            <p>Wherefore be ye not at all diſcouraged, neither be afraid of their faces, but gird on ſtrength, and go on in the Name of the Lord. Is the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> Champion come forth to defie the Armies of the living God? doth he preſent himſelf fourty dayes, vaunting againſt his true <hi>Iſrael?</hi> doth he threaten to give your fleſh to the Fowls of the Air, and to the Beaſts of the field, to ſell you for bond-men and bond-women? doth the hearts of any among your Tribes begin to faint at the hearing of his voyce? doth the height of his ſtature make you afraid? why, let no mans heart fail becauſe of him; for behold, I ſee little <hi>David</hi> (your Prince) with the ſling in his hand, and the ſmooth ſtone in the Shepherds bag, in the midſt of you, running to meet him in the name and power of the Lord God of the Armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he hath defied, who will ſmite the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed in heart and ears, by the dread of his preſence, which ſhall ariſe in the hearts of his Choſen, in the day of Battel; for he hath already delivered from the mouth of the Lion, and from the paw of the Bear, and he will alſo deliver us from this uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> who ſhall be made like one of them. Therefore fear not, ye ſons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but be very couragious, be not at all diſmayed at his high looks, nor daunted at his chaleng, but let us go on in the Name of the Lord our God, let us keep open <hi>Daniels</hi> Caſement towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as at other times, let us not regard any thing or Decree, contrary to the Worſhip of our God. Come ye Babes, lift up your heads in the pure ſtrength of the Moſt High, for I feel <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Joſhua, Daniel</hi> and <hi>David</hi> amongſt you, and the ſpirits of all juſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42618:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>men from <hi>Abel</hi> to this day are ſtirring up to help you (bleſſed is the eye, that perfectly feeth theſe things) yea, the Lord of Hoſts himſelf ſhall fight for you, and give you the victory, for the Battel is the Lords, its againſt Him and his Truth (which muſt ſpread over all the earth, as the waters cover the Sea) that the Potſherds have ſet themſelves, who can daſh and conſume them in a moment, and will, when their work is done, and their time expired: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay again, in the Name and dreadful Authority of my God, fear them not, the Day is yours, I ſee them all ſcattered as duſt before the wind, that riſe up againſt you, who have no helper in the earth, but from the Lord alone; ye called, choſen and ſaithful Ones, ye dear Lambs of my Father, gird on ſtrength and valour; my ſoul rejoyceth in God, and my ſpirit doth magnifie him who is the Saviour of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and my heart doth leap for joy, to ſee and feel your faithfulneſs unto death, and what this day will bring forth to his eternal glory, and renown of his Name, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting comfort of you his people. The Lord will determine the Controverſie, and make a ſhort work in the earth. Now ſhall ye be as a City ſet on a Hill, that ſhall ſhine throughout the world: now ſhall the Arm of the Lord your God be revealed to the ends of the earth, in behalf of his precious Seed, which hath long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hard bondage and ſore captivity.</p>
            <p>And now many are the eyes that are fixed upon you, to ſee what will become of you in this day of tryal, who will have cauſe to glorifie and bleſs the Name of your God, through your faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, courage, and boldneſs in the Truth, whereby many ſhall be drawn towards you, who will take hold of your skirts, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Lord of Heaven is with you; and a multitude ſhall be converted to him, and the deſert ſhall be glad for him, and the wilderneſs ſhall rejoyce becauſe of him, who is come to reign in Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> before his Ancients gloriouſly. Wherefore, ye dear Children, let this be your care and diligence to walk circumſpectly towards them that are yet without, by keeping clear, walking with God in the pure ſtill, retired life, in the inward parts, in which ye may ſee and judg every motion, and feel power to ſubdue and reign over all that is contrary.</p>
            <p>So dear Babes of God, dwell very ſtill, cool, and calm in your minds, that ye may be preſerved out of the forward, haſty ſpirit,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42618:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>(which hath alwayes betrayed the innocent) and be kept back to the everlaſting Foundation and Rock of the Generation of the righteous, whoſe dwelling place and refuge is the Name of the Lord in all Ages, who hid them in the hollow of his hand, and under the ſhadow of his wings, in the day of ſtorms and raging Tempeſts of the wicked. So caſt all your care upon him, for he careth for you, and his eye beholds you, which ſeeth in ſ cret, who is bringing his Seed through the fire and through the water, that all his people might be as fine Gold ſeven times tryed. And as for the wicked, your enemies and oppreſſors, look not at all at them or their power, their ſtrength is a Reed of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their time and power is limited, but ſtill look to the Lord, in whom is your help, in whoſe Name, and pure Dominion, and everlaſting Authority, I give forth this Teſtimony unto you his people and children, that the day is at hand which ſhall burn as an Oven, and all the proud, and all that do wickedly ſhall be as ſtubble, and the day that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſhall burn them up, and ſhall leave them neither <hi>Root</hi> nor <hi>Branch,</hi> yea, the very <hi>Root</hi> of the wicked, as well as the Branch, will the Lord our God conſume and deſtroy by the brightneſs of his ariſing. O happy day, bleſſed for ever, ſing and rejoyce ye holy Prophets and Saints of the Moſt High, for the day of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion approacheth, when all our burdens, oppreſſions, labour and travails ſhall ceaſe; leap for joy, ye Babes in the womb of the Morning of this bleſſed day, at the ſound of this Salvation, for its from your Father, the everlaſting God, that liveth for ever, who hath ſaid it, and will accompliſh it, yea, the zeal of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this. O ye dear Children, I ſay again, lift up your heads, watch, and be ſober, Behold, the Bridegroom cometh be ready ye wiſe Virgins with your Lamps alway trim'd, and your Veſſels full of oyl, that ye may behold his glorious ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and ſee his wonders in the deep: For verily the day of our God is come as a Thief in the night, upon all the world of ungodly, who will not believe if one ſhould riſe from the dead, and declare it unto them, whoſe eyes the god of the world hath blinded, that they cannot perceive the Signs of the times, of which many are paſt already, and the laſt Sign is approaching, <hi>viz.

            <p>So theſe things aroſe in my heart by the Spirit of the Lord, to give forth unto you his choſen, that it might be as an inſtrument of encouragement to your precious Faith and Patience, againſt all oppoſition within and without, in this day of tryal and hour of temptation; for my ſoul is greatly refreſht as with new wine, in the ſence of what our God is haſtning to bring forth, and of the portion of my cup I have freely let forth unto you his children, dearly ſaluting you with tender Bowels and pure Breathings and Deſires, unto my God for you all, that we might all be kept ſtaid, chaſt, ſingle, innocent and valiant, in the ſtrength of the enjoyment of his love, to ſerve and honour him in this our day and generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even while we have a Being; to whom my ſoul aſcribeth all glory and thanks, in the living ſence of his unſpeakable mercies. <hi>Amen. The God of Love and Peace be with your ſpirit. Amen.</hi>
